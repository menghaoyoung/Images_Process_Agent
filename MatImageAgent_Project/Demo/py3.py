        'distribution of grayscale values and converted them to u_eq values using a linear transformation. '
        'The analysis reveals patterns in the displacement field that provide insights into the material\'s structural '

        'to extract quantitative data from qualitative visual information. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of '
        'this approach in characterizing material properties through image analysis, offering a foundation for further '
        'studies in material science and computational imaging. The calculated line segment length of ' + line_length + 
        ' and the u_eq distribution along this segment provide valuable metrics for understanding the material\'s '

        'value distributions. The analysis focuses on a specific line segment within a microscopic image, extracting grayscale '
        'values and converting them to equivalent displacement values (u_eq). The relationship between grayscale values and '
        'displacement fields is established through a linear transformation, where the minimum and maximum displacement values '
        'correspond to the grayscale range of 0-255. This approach allows for quantitative analysis of material deformation '
        'or structural characteristics that may not be immediately apparent through visual inspection alone. '
        'The significance of this study lies in its ability to bridge qualitative visual data with quantitative metrics, '
        'enabling more precise characterization of material properties. By establishing a methodology for extracting displacement '
        'fields from images, this research contributes to the broader field of computational materials science and provides '
        'a foundation for more advanced analyses of material behavior under various conditions. The specific focus on the '

    methods = doc.add_paragraph(
        'The methodology employed in this study involves several key steps in image processing and data analysis. First, '
        'a grayscale image was read using the Python Imaging Library (PIL), and a specific line segment was defined by its '
        'start point ' + start_point + ' and end point ' + end_point + '. Using Bresenham\'s algorithm, we identified all pixels '
        'along this line segment and extracted their corresponding grayscale values (ranging from 0 to 255). The physical '
        'length of the line segment was calculated using the image resolution of ' + resolution + '. '
        'To transform grayscale values into equivalent displacement values (u_eq), we applied a linear mapping using the formula: '
        'u_eq = u_min + (gray_values / 255) * u_max, where u_min = 0 and u_max = 65535. This transformation assumes a direct '
        'proportional relationship between grayscale intensity and displacement magnitude. The resulting u_eq values were then '
        'plotted against the distance from the starting point of the line segment, providing a spatial distribution of the '
        'displacement field. All data, including grayscale values, calculated u_eq values, and the line segment length, were '
        'systematically recorded in CSV and text files for further analysis and reproducibility. The visualization of the u_eq '
        'distribution was generated using Matplotlib and saved as a high-resolution TIFF image. This methodological approach '
        'ensures transparency and reproducibility, allowing for verification of results and potential extension of the analysis '

        'The analysis of the grayscale distribution along the specified line segment yielded significant insights into the '
        'spatial variation of the material properties. As shown in Fig. 1, the u_eq values exhibit a distinct pattern when '
        'plotted against the distance from the starting point. This pattern reflects the underlying structural characteristics '
        'of the material captured in the microscopic image. '
        f'The measured length of the line segment was {line_length}, traversing from the start point {start_point} to the end '
        f'point {end_point}. The average u_eq value along this segment was {avg_u_eq:.2f}, with a maximum value of {max_u_eq:.2f} '
        f'and a minimum value of {min_u_eq:.2f}. This range indicates significant variation in the displacement field across '
        f'the analyzed region. '
        f'The correlation between distance and u_eq values suggests that the material properties are not uniform throughout the '
        f'analyzed region, which could be attributed to various factors such as material composition, structural defects, or '
        f'localized stress concentrations. The gradient of u_eq values provides valuable information about the rate of change '
        f'in material properties, which can be further analyzed to identify regions of interest for more detailed investigation. '
        f'These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the employed methodology in extracting quantitative data from '
        f'microscopic images, offering a foundation for more advanced analyses of material behavior and properties. The '
        f'approach can be extended to analyze multiple line segments or entire regions of interest within the image, providing '
