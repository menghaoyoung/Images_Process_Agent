        "specific grayscale value ranges and pattern continuity criteria. Using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization "
        "(CLAHE) for image enhancement and pixel-level analysis, we identified regions meeting the GAP criteria defined as pixels "
        "with grayscale values between 1-150 and having at least one adjacent direction with 25 contiguous pixels meeting the same "
        "grayscale condition. The analysis generated both quantitative data in CSV format and visual representations highlighting "
        "GAP regions in black against a white background. A total of " + str(len(visualization_images)) + " polymer images were processed, "
        "revealing distinct pattern distributions across different samples. These results provide valuable insights into the structural "
        "characteristics and potential anomalies within the polymer surfaces, which can inform further materials science research and "

        "Polymer surface analysis is crucial in materials science and engineering, providing essential information about material "

        "This study implements an image processing methodology to identify specific grayscale patterns, termed Grayscale Anomaly "
        "Patterns (GAP), within polymer surface images. These patterns may correspond to structural features, compositional variations, "
        "or manufacturing artifacts that could influence material performance and quality.\n\n"
        
        "The GAP conditions are defined by two key criteria:\n"
        "1. Pixels with grayscale values between 1 and 150 (inclusive)\n"
        "2. Pixels that have at least one adjacent direction (up, down, left, or right) containing 25 contiguous pixels that also "
        "meet the grayscale condition\n\n"
        
        "These criteria were specifically designed to identify regions with particular grayscale characteristics and spatial continuity, "
        "which may indicate important material properties or anomalies. By applying these criteria systematically across multiple polymer "
        "samples, we aim to provide quantitative data on pattern distribution and characteristics, enabling more informed material "
