        'that are adjacent to at least 25 contiguous pixels meeting the same grayscale criteria. These GAP regions potentially '

        'Equalization (CLAHE) for image enhancement and custom algorithms for pixel connectivity analysis, we processed six '
        'polymer microscopy images to identify and visualize GAP patterns. The results reveal distinct distributions of GAP '
        'pixels across different samples, providing valuable insights into polymer microstructure. The comprehensive pixel-by-pixel '
        'analysis stored in CSV format enables further quantitative assessment, while the visual representations highlight '
        'spatial patterns that may correlate with polymer properties or manufacturing processes. This methodology offers a '
        'standardized approach to identifying structural patterns in polymer samples, with potential applications in quality '
