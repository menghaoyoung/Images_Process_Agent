        "The analysis of polymer surface characteristics plays a crucial role in materials science and "
        "engineering, providing insights into material properties, performance, and quality. Surface "
        "features, particularly those defined by specific grayscale patterns and spatial relationships, "
        "can reveal important information about material composition, manufacturing processes, and "
        "potential defects.\n\n"
        
        "In this study, we focus on the identification and analysis of GAP pixels in polymer surface "
        "images. GAP pixels are defined by two key criteria: (1) grayscale values between 1-150, and "
        "(2) the presence of at least 25 contiguous pixels in one direction (up, down, left, or right) "
        "that also meet the grayscale criterion. These specific parameters were selected to identify "
        "meaningful patterns and structures within the polymer surfaces.\n\n"
        
        "The purpose of this analysis is to develop a quantitative understanding of GAP pixel distribution "
        "across multiple polymer samples. By applying advanced image processing techniques and custom "
        "algorithms, we aim to extract valuable information that can inform material development, quality "
        "control, and manufacturing processes. The results of this analysis provide both visual "
        "representations and numerical data that characterize the surface properties of the examined "
        "polymer samples."

    methods_text = (
        "Our analysis methodology combined image processing techniques with custom algorithms to identify "
        "and visualize GAP pixels in polymer surface images. The process consisted of the following steps:\n\n"
        
        "1. Image Collection and Preprocessing: We collected multiple polymer surface images with the "
        "prefix 'Poly_' in PNG or JPG format. These images served as the raw data for our analysis.\n\n"
        
        "2. Image Enhancement: We applied Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) with "
        "a clip limit of 3 and tile grid size of 10Ã—10 to enhance the visibility of surface features. "
        "CLAHE is particularly effective for improving local contrast while preventing the overamplification "
        "of noise, making it ideal for detecting subtle surface variations.\n\n"
        
        "3. Grayscale Conversion: The enhanced images were converted to grayscale using the PIL library, "
        "allowing us to analyze pixel intensity values on a standardized scale from 0 to 255.\n\n"
        
        "4. GAP Pixel Identification: We implemented an algorithm to identify GAP pixels based on two "
        "specific criteria:\n"
        "   a. Grayscale value between 1-150 (inclusive)\n"
        "   b. At least one adjacent direction (up, down, left, or right) containing 25 contiguous pixels "
        "      that also meet the grayscale value criterion\n\n"
        
        "5. Data Compilation: For each image, we generated a comprehensive CSV file containing pixel "
        "coordinates (row, column), grayscale values, and GAP flags (1 for GAP pixels, 0 for non-GAP pixels).\n\n"
        
        "6. Visualization: We created visual representations of the results by generating new images that "
        "highlight GAP pixels in black (RGB: 0, 0, 0) against a white background (RGB: 255, 255, 255), "
        "providing an intuitive way to observe the spatial distribution of GAP regions.\n\n"
        
        "This methodology combines quantitative analysis with visual representation, enabling both "
        "numerical evaluation and pattern recognition in the study of polymer surface characteristics."
