        'and analysis of GAP conditions in polymer images, where GAP refers to specific pixel '
        'characteristics that may indicate important structural features.\n\n'
        'The GAP condition is defined by two primary criteria: (1) pixels with grayscale '
        'values between 1 and 150, and (2) pixels that have at least one adjacent pixel '
        'with 25 contiguous pixels meeting the grayscale condition. These criteria were '

        'from the specified directory.\n\n'
        '2. CLAHE Enhancement: Each image underwent Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram '
        'Equalization (CLAHE) with a clip limit of 3 and tile grid size of 10Ã—10. This '
        'enhancement technique was selected for its ability to improve local contrast while '
        'avoiding the noise amplification that can occur with standard histogram equalization.\n\n'
        '3. Grayscale Conversion: The enhanced images were converted to grayscale using the PIL '
        'library to facilitate pixel-level analysis based on intensity values.\n\n'
        '4. GAP Analysis: We analyzed each pixel to determine if it met the GAP conditions: '
        'grayscale value between 1-150 and having at least one adjacent pixel with 25 '
        'contiguous pixels meeting the grayscale condition. This analysis used a breadth-first '
        'search algorithm to efficiently identify contiguous pixel regions.\n\n'
        '5. Visualization: We generated binary images highlighting GAP pixels in black and '
        'non-GAP pixels in white, providing a clear visual representation of the GAP distribution.\n\n'
        '6. Data Export: For each image, we created a comprehensive CSV file containing '
        'pixel coordinates, grayscale values, and GAP flags (0 or 1) for all pixels, enabling '
        'further statistical analysis.'
